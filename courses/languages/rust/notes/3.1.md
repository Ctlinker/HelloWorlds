# Note of Work

## Summary

The principle is simple, taking as example the guessing game by
`The Rust Programming Language`; Make a derivative, In this case a luck based
game where from a set of choices, one can know how well his/her tomorrow will
go.

### v0.0.0

```rs
use rand::Rng;
use std::io;

const DICT: [&str; 9] = [
    "cool", "perfect", "dreadful", "awful", "magic", "unicorn", "hot", "horny", "shitty",
];

fn get_rand(start: u8, end: u8) -> u8 {
    return rand::thread_rng().gen_range(start..=end);
}

fn get_3_rand(start: u8, end: u8) -> [u8; 3] {
    return [
        get_rand(start, end),
        get_rand(start, end),
        get_rand(start, end),
    ];
}

fn main() {
    println!("Sup, welcome to my lil guessing game");
    println!("Type, 1, 2, or 3 to know how tomorrow will go");
    println!("ready go: ?");

    let result = get_3_rand(0, 9);

    let mut guess = String::new();

    loop {
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Error, while reading line");

        let guess: usize = guess.trim().parse().expect("Error while reading line");

        // if guess < 0 {
        //     println!("too small");
        //     continue;
        // } else

        if guess > 3 {
            println!("too big");
            continue;
        }

        let index: usize = result[guess - 1].into();

        let msg = DICT[index];
        println!("Your tomorrow will be {msg}");
        break;
    }
}
```

### Observation

- Strangely the rust-analyzer is not responding

- **Typing**, Rust is nefariously picky on that

- **String** can be explicitly represented with the type `str`
  > Yet I see something weird, on test of **`DICT`** const declaration, I've
  > been recommended to use **`[&str; 9]`**; Yes how to define array but why do
  > I need the **`&`** reference operator ? And then why is it fine to `[u8; 3]`
  > ? Is some sort of return copy vs original ?
- **Any Integer** as **`.into()`** method which allow one to cast the number as
  another sub type, eg `u8 -> usize`

- **When Dealing with unsigned integers**, expression like :

  ```rs
   if guess < 0 {
      println!("too small");
      continue;
  }
  ```

  **Are Basically Useless** as it's unsigned so negativity doesn't exist
