# In A Nutshell

**_This Project Host My Hello To Many Worlds_**.

It's, no tutorial, nor notebook, but just a trace for my future self on how I've
a few learned things.

You can scramble, through my notes/files if it help you a bit. But be warned,
there's quite a lot of self talk, assumption and `Hum...` moment, As I try to
understand what I'm dealing with.

So I'm done with the yapping, enjoy the ride, whoever is reading this
