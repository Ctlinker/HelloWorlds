## variable in depth

Mess around with the variable and see how it play out.

### v0.0.0

```rs
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

#### Observation

**assignment:**

- Rust as a rigged safety, on var immutability, the code won't compile if one
  try to mutate something that's not mutable:
  `cannot assign twice to immutable variable "x"`

- Again by adding the `mut` keyword, one can force mutability

### v0.1.0

```rs
fn main (){
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
println!("{THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS}")
}
```

#### Observation

**constant:**

These are immutable variable as well, except they:

- Can't be used alongside mut
- Can only receive literal value, not a result of some sort of fn
- And must use **`uppercase`** along with **`snake_case`** as variable names

### v0.2.0

variable override **`(shadowing)`**

```rs
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of original x is: {x}");
}
```

#### Observation

**Shadowing is, akin to redefining the variable** in a given scope, executing
this code, one will see:

```plaintext
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
"The value of original x is: 6
```

Yet it's different from mutability:

```rs
let mut x = 10
x = 15
```

mutability still conserve the type, so :

```rs
let mut x  = "long_str"
x = 20 // X is a string so this throw an error
```

but with **shadowing, with redeclare the variable with a new type, & mutability
parameter**:

```rs
let mut x = "long_string"
let x: u32 = x.len()
```

As `x` is redeclared a immutable number
