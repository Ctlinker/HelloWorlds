## Loops In Rust

Rust as three kind of loop

### The Loop Keyword (Just run, No question ask, I'll stop you myself)

the loop keyword create an infinite loop that can only be stop through break
statement; or `ctrl+c` while running in terminal

**syntax:**

```rs
loop {
    if everything_is_fine {
        // keep going forward
    } else if some_err {
        break
    }
}
```

**assignability:**

Yes a loop is also an expression in rust:

```rs
let mut counter = 0;

let result = loop {
    counter += 1;
    if counter == 10 {
        break counter * 2;
    }
};

println!("The result is {result}");
```

What's happening here ?

- We declare a mutable var `counter`
- A var result to whome we seemingly assign a loop

Or is it ? look right here `break counter * 2;`

The break statement came before ? so technialy speaking we're out the right
after it right ?; so `counter * 2;` is what end up being evaluted as assigned
val to result ? and take a closer look, there's a `;` why ?

Simply cause = let myvar = ...; is a statement and in any case statement must
end by a `;`
