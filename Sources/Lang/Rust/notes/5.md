# Note Of Work

## if-else

### **syntax:**

```rs
if some_condition == true {
    // do this
} else if something_else == true {
    // do that instead
} else {
    // do this
}
```

### **operators:**

- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `==` exactly equals
- `%` rest of division

### **assignablity:**

if-else which in othere language would be statetement, are considered as
expression in Rust

Meaning they can evaluate to values, so:

```rs
let test = if some_condition = true { "passed" } else { "failed" };
```

Is totaly valide rust code.

To me it mirror the ternary operator style in js
